# Chapter 1: The Hunt Begins (200 points / 32 solves)

The elusive cyber criminal "Kira" has made his presence known online, leaving cryptic clues for his followers on a hidden Instagram page. The investigator "L" must track these clues to begin the hunt.

Chapter 2 will unlock after solving this one..

## Overview

The challenge says that Kira has left a cryptic "clue" on his Instagram Page. Since there's no proper username mentioned, it's safe to assume it's probably in the BSides Dehradun page.

And sure enough, we find the post with the cryptic "clue" (https://www.instagram.com/p/C_VbWOySlhV/).

Straight away, `LazdoaUerzrdev{N3LM0U3_70_7Y3_D347R_V073_T7F}` seems like it's either ROT13 or Vignere.
